        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <h3>Billings Chamber of Commerce</h3>
        <p>I chose to create a website for the Chamber of Commerce of Billings, Montana, USA. I grew up in Billings and just recently moved back to the city. I have spent a lot of time in community involvement and leadership in this town, and am familiar with both old and new businesses in the area.</p>
        
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>As the largest city in the state of Montana, Billings is key to economic growth in the Western Montana region. The Billings Chamber of Commerce will provide a place for local businesses and other community members and organizations to communicate together and participate in community leadership and policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>What new businesses will be opening in this area in the coming year?</p>
        <p>Where can I find the contact information of local business and community leaders?</p>
        <p>What kind of information or incentives does the Billings Chamber of Commerce provide to prospective businesses?</p>
